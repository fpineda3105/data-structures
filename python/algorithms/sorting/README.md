# Sorting algorithms

We need sometimes order a list of elements based on a criteria, like ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for efficiency of other algorithms on top of that such as Binary search.

## Quick sort

It takes a element as a pivot and separate the minor and the major elements. Recursively repeat the same process for the list of minor and the list of major. At the end it concatenate the list of minor (ordered), the pivot and the list of major(ordered).
