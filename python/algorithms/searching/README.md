# Searching algorithms

It's all about check for an element in any data structure. Can be classified based on their mechanishm of searching.

## Linear search

Check every element, one by one until found the element.

## Binary search

It works only on sorted data structures. It's more efficient than linear search because does not need to check for every element. Repeadly check for the half in the list whether it's less or greater than the element until found it.
